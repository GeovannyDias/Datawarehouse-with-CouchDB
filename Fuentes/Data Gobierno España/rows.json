I am learning to trust people and if you go slow with me, I melt in your fingertips!  I'm such a sweetheart and I will rub my head and neck on your hand and want to snuggle.  I am actually comforted when held and snuggled!   I'm warming up to people and need a home that can help me to continue to grow and learn what true love really is!<p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",

My name is Dozer and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on 9/20/18.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to sit. I'm high energy and need lots of walks and enrichment activities in my life to keep me busy! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. But, I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only animal in my new home, because I was never socialized properly with animals when I was young. I could likely do well with certain large dogs if we are introduced slowly and cautiously. I would most prefer to be the only apple to your eye!<p/><p/><p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",

This three-month old sweetheart has one undeveloped eye, but it doesn't slow him down a bit. We call him PurrSortaSee (Purrcy for short) because of his beautiful, loud purr and that he can \"sorta see.\" His personality type is GREEN. He's extremely playful and energetic, yet greets you with loud purrs, kitty kisses, and face caresses every time you wake him from his many naps. Our other nicknames for him are Bink or Pouncer (because his favorite pastime is leaping after any moving toy or wand). He's a beautiful little sweetheart with lots of love and joy to bring to any family. He's neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, and litter trained. His adoption fee includes a free visit to the veterinarian of your choice and 30 days of opt-in pet insurance through Trupanion. Contact us to meet him. He looks forward to finding his forever family!<p/>Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set. Please inquire with the shelter.<p/>", null ]

My name is Rosie and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in to the shelter a few months ago and I've gone to two seperate homes for trial periods so that I could show my true colors of the type of dog I am. I am a very affectionate and loving dog with my people. I know that I can be a bit of a handful, but if the right training program gets established, the payoff will be completely worth it!<p/><p/>When I first arrived at the shelter, I was incredibly undersocialized and completely terrified. I have come out of my shell significantly and I have made very clear what I need in my life. <p/><p/>I need a home that has no other animals (especially small ones), I can tolerate most big dogs but I would really prefer to be alone with my people. I need a home that will work my anxiety issues; this means that I may need to have specific diet plans, regular enrichment, trust building exercises, positive reinforcement training, and would do best if a trainer could come in and help my people immediately with transitioning me. I have anxiety because I was not properly socialized when I was younger, so now I need a more consistent and structured life. I don't respond well to aversive training, so a structured positive reinforcement training would be required to help me thrive.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p/>", null ]

I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to \"sit\", \"stay\", \"come\", \"down\" and \"shake\".<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>Because of my high energy and nervousness with new people and in new situations, I would do best in a home without children.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with someone that is knowledgeable, dog savvy and willing to work with me to help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>", "RED" ]

My name is Stevia and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 4, 2018. My owners would describe me as shy and timid. <p/><p/>I'm very shy at first, but if you take the time to get to know my, I can be quite the sweet lady. I absolutely love cat trees and claiming them as my fortress! Please take me home and spoil me with all the treats a kitty could enjoy! <p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet adult only home .<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "RED" ]

She is an 11-year-old adoptable cat currently living in a foster home. Unlike most fosters she's not in care because of her age or her health, but because of her attitude. When she first came to the shelter she was hissy and snarly and very difficult to manage. Ordinarily a cat that unfriendly to humans would be put up for adoption as a barn cat, but Gertie is front declawed and would never be able to defend herself outdoors. Her only hope was to get away from the stress of the shelter environment to see if some loving care could bring her back to the light side.<p/><p/>After months in foster care Gertie is a changed cat. Granted, she's still something of a curmudgeon and has definite opinions about how things ought to be, but she enjoys petting and brushing, and has a rumbling purr that she's happy to share. She is more than ready to go to her forever home, ideally where she can rule over her own private space. Gertie needs an adopter who is willing to learn her signals and respect her limits, and who appreciates that winning the heart of a \"difficult\" animal is well worth the patience it will require.
