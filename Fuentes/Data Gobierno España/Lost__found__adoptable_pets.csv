I LOVE LOVE LOVE Tennis Balls! They are the best part about life!  Food's pretty awesome too! I'm pretty friendly with everyone I meet, but I may do better with older kids because I am still working on my manners. I can easily be walked on leash near other dogs but I don't tend to be face to face meeting them. I'd prefer to be the only animal in the household so I can get all of your attention!<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",RED

My name is Cleo and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on November 9th, 2018, because I did not get along with the other dog in the home. I lived in a home with a large dog and a 15 year old child. My previous owner described me as very affectionate, fearful and shy.<p/><p/>I am a shy gal who just needs to go to a home that will understand that I am scared of the world. I need to go to a home that has no other pets as I tend to like humans way more than dogs. I would also need a family that will understand that taking some time to get to know me and help me learn that the world is not a scary place and that I can be a confident dog, would be wonderful! I would also prefer a home that only has children that are dog savvy  and teenager +. Once you do get to know me you will get a sweet girl that just wants to snuggle + sleep in bed with you, binge watch netflix, snuggle up with you and a good book, and be your best friend! <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",BLUE

I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>I am a dog with a huge personality and I have a lot of favorite activities. One of my favorite things to do is go on walks and explore! I also love to play fetch and will bark at you to throw my toy so I really want a big yard, though I am not always as excited about bringing it back so playing with two toys at once is the best option for me!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to be interested in other dogs but may be too intrusive and pushy for some. I would do best meeting any new friends before going home. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>I would do best in a home with older kids or adults only. <p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",

My previous owner described me as smart, protective, and playful.<p/><p/>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing! I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality!  I am full of energy and I love to play! I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.  I would do best in a home without young children.<p/><p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p/>",RED

This three-month old sweetheart has one undeveloped eye, but it doesn't slow him down a bit. We call him PurrSortaSee (Purrcy for short) because of his beautiful, loud purr and that he can ""sorta see."" His personality type is GREEN. He's extremely playful and energetic, yet greets you with loud purrs, kitty kisses, and face caresses every time you wake him from his many naps. Our other nicknames for him are Bink or Pouncer (because his favorite pastime is leaping after any moving toy or wand). He's a beautiful little sweetheart with lots of love and joy to bring to any family. He's neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, and litter trained. His adoption fee includes a free visit to the veterinarian of your choice and 30 days of opt-in pet insurance through Trupanion. Contact us to meet him. He looks forward to finding his forever family!<p/>Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set. Please inquire with the shelter.<p/>",

My name is Wilson and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on November 16th, 2018, because they were not allowed to have pets where they lived. I lived in a home with a bunch of young guys. My previous owner described me as playful, outgoing, and loving.<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break. Although I can sometimes be a overstimulated, I am quite snuggly and calm when I get the outlets I need to get some of my energy out. I would actually love to go to a home with another confident kitty friend, so I have a friend for life! <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",

My name is Rosie and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in to the shelter a few months ago and I've gone to two seperate homes for trial periods so that I could show my true colors of the type of dog I am. I am a very affectionate and loving dog with my people. I know that I can be a bit of a handful, but if the right training program gets established, the payoff will be completely worth it!<p/><p/>When I first arrived at the shelter, I was incredibly undersocialized and completely terrified. I have come out of my shell significantly and I have made very clear what I need in my life. <p/><p/>I need a home that has no other animals (especially small ones), I can tolerate most big dogs but I would really prefer to be alone with my people. I need a home that will work my anxiety issues; this means that I may need to have specific diet plans, regular enrichment, trust building exercises, positive reinforcement training, and would do best if a trainer could come in and help my people immediately with transitioning me. I have anxiety because I was not properly socialized when I was younger, so now I need a more consistent and structured life. I don't respond well to aversive training, so a structured positive reinforcement training would be required to help me thrive.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p/>",

I do enjoy getting soft pets on my head.<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without children.<p/><p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

She is an 11-year-old adoptable cat currently living in a foster home. Unlike most fosters she's not in care because of her age or her health, but because of her attitude. When she first came to the shelter she was hissy and snarly and very difficult to manage. Ordinarily a cat that unfriendly to humans would be put up for adoption as a barn cat, but Gertie is front declawed and would never be able to defend herself outdoors. Her only hope was to get away from the stress of the shelter environment to see if some loving care could bring her back to the light side.<p/><p/>After months in foster care Gertie is a changed cat. Granted, she's still something of a curmudgeon and has definite opinions about how things ought to be, but she enjoys petting and brushing, and has a rumbling purr that she's happy to share. She is more than ready to go to her forever home, ideally where she can rule over her own private space. Gertie needs an adopter who is willing to learn her signals and respect her limits, and who appreciates that winning the heart of a ""difficult"" animal is well worth the patience it will require.
